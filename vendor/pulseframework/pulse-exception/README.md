# pulse-exception

## Installation & loading
PulseException is available on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/pulseframework/pulse-exception) (using semantic versioning), and installation via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) is the recommended way to install PulseException. Just add this line to your `composer.json` file:

```json
"pulseframework/pulse-exception": "~1.0"
```

or run

```sh
composer require pulseframework/pulse-exception
```

Note that the `vendor` folder and the `vendor/autoload.php` script are generated by Composer; they are not part of PulseException

You need to define: `_MODE_DEV_`, `_ROOT_DIR_`
