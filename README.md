# pulsedb
Pulse Data Base Connector

## Installation & loading
Monday API is available on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/pulseframework/pulsedb) (using semantic versioning), and installation via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) is the recommended way to install PulseDB. Just add this line to your `composer.json` file:

```json
"pulseframework/pulsedb": "~0.1"
```

or run

```sh
composer require pulseframework/pulsedb
```

Note that the `vendor` folder and the `vendor/autoload.php` script are generated by Composer; they are not part of Monday API
